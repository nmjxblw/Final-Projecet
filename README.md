The plot of our game is a plot about the eternal cycle. In the dungeon, the main location for the development of our plot, there will appear the main characters located in three different timelines. They are all located in the dungeon, but they come from different times.

**Data-driven experience progression:**

We store most of our game text in a file called InGameData.json and the player's state and volume settings in a file called SaveData.json.
